# ERD Requirements for Airbnb Database

## Objective

The objective of this task is to design and document an Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD) that models the core structure of the Airbnb database system.

The ERD should clearly define entities, attributes, and relationships that reflect the expected structure of the application and support key business operations such as user registration, property listings, bookings, and reviews.

## Instructions

1. Identify and define all relevant entities, including but not limited to:
   - `User`
   - `Property`
   - `Booking`
   - `Review`
   - `Location`
   - `Payment`

2. Specify attributes for each entity, including:
   - Primary keys
   - Foreign keys
   - Data types
   - Constraints (e.g., NOT NULL, UNIQUE)

3. Define the relationships between entities:
   - One-to-many (e.g., one user can have many bookings)
   - Many-to-many (e.g., properties and amenities)
   - Use crowâ€™s foot notation (or equivalent) to illustrate relationships

4. Tools:
   - The diagram should be created using a visual tool such as **draw.io**, **dbdiagram.io**, or **Lucidchart**
   - Export the diagram as both `.drawio` (editable) and `.png` (viewable)

## Deliverables

- ER Diagram:  
  - Image: `ER Diagram.png`  

- This requirements file: `requirements.md`

- All files should be placed in the `ERD/` directory of the `alx-airbnb-database` GitHub repository.

## Notes

- The diagram should reflect real-world use cases for an Airbnb-like platform.
- Ensure entity and attribute names are meaningful and consistent.
- Optional: include short descriptions or comments in the diagram for clarity.
- Commit your diagram and requirements file using meaningful Git commit messages.
